    "The [movie dataset on which this case study is based](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) is a database of 5000 movies catalogued by [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en). The information available about each movie is its budget, revenue, rating, actors and actresses, etc. In this case study, we will use this dataset to determine whether any information about a movie can predict the total revenue of a movie. We will also attempt to predict whether a movie's revenue will exceed its budget.\n",

    "\n",
    "It appears that the variables `budget`, `popularity`, `runtime`, `vote_count`, and `revenue` are all right-skewed. In this exercise, we will transform these variables to eliminate this skewness. Specifically, we will use the `np.log10()` method. Because some of these variable values are exactly 0, we will add a small positive value to each to ensure it is defined; this is necessary because log(0) is negative infinity.\n",
